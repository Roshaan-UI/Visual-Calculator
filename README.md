# 🎯 Percentage Calculator - GUI Edition

A modern, clean, and user-friendly **Python GUI app** that calculates the percentage of marks and assigns grades based on the result.

This is a personal project by [@Roshaan](https://github.com/Roshaan), built using **Tkinter** with custom styling, a Gothic font, smooth layout, and polished interface. Designed as part of my early journey in Python development.
